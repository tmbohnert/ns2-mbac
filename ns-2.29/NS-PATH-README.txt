IMPORTANT NOTICES:

(1) You MUST put /opt/ns-2/ns-allinone-2.29/otcl-1.11, /opt/ns-2/ns-allinone-2.29/lib,
    into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    If it complains about X libraries, add path to your X libraries
    into LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    If you are using csh, you can set it like:
                setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <paths>
    If you are using sh, you can set it like:
                export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<paths>

(2) You MUST put /opt/ns-2/ns-allinone-2.29/tcl8.4.11/library into your TCL_LIBRARY environmental
    variable. Otherwise ns/nam will complain during startup.
